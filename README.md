bootstrap_MockupTheme
=====================

a bootstrap theme that will make your site look more like a prototype.

setup
-----
1.) clone this repo
2.) download Bootstrap from [http://getbootstrap.com]
3.) in the bootstrap_MockupTheme file `mockupTheme-bootstrap.less` set the path to the `/less/bootstrap.less` (first line) 
and `/less/utilities.less` (last line) files of bootstrap. (the current paths work out of the box, if you place the repoâ€™s files 
in a new folder in bootstraps root folder (the one with `README.md` and the `LICENSE` in) 
4.) open a terminal, navigate to the folder you put this repo (bootstrap_MockupTheme) in and run `lessc custom-bootstrap.less bootstrap.css`
The resulting `css` file is created from the standard bootstrap files and has the MockupTheme customizations baked in.
